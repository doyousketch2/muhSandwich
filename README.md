To use this, you'll need Löve2d  
https://love2d.org  

Linux: *enter dir, then type*  
`love .`  

Win, Mac:  *drag folder on Love shortcut*  

for more info, see https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started  

Android:  use any file manager that lets you *Open As...*  
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alphainventor.filemanager  

Open a .love file as other, complete action using Löve for Android.  
Alternatively, open the folder, and do the same thing with *main.lua*
